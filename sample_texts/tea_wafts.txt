Tea Wafts

ON THIS DAY, like most other summer days in Rambagh, the sun smiled benevolently over the rolling, equably green hills covered with tea gardens. Resting his arms on the fence of a chicken coop stood Rajneet Singh, popularly known as Sardarji and the owner of Rajgarh estates. He gave a passing glance to the distant blotched lavender Himalayas in the Eastern horizon and then the crisp sky before lovingly fixing his gaze upon his darling, Miss Bonita, lounging in the sun. She intermittently pecked at the grains in her native henly manner; her red crown elegantly poised, and her brown plumage shining like a waxed car. Satisfied with barley and millets, she moved on to corn.
